title: ...And thoughts

The original idea about this blog was to present technical stuff. That's why I wrote in the subtitle *"the place where I weave bits"*. 

I've found it a bit limiting because I should also write about technology and expose, and possibly defend, my points of view. This boils down to taking a stand about things instead of trying to stay as neutral as possible.

I was thinking about it this morning while going to the office, and this is definitely part of a bigger reflection which, by the way, this blog is a by-product.

So let me add this to the resolutions I took at the beginning of the year 2011.

From now on this will be *the place where I weave bits... and thoughts!*
