I am truly, completely, utterly and totally amazed by this man who, at the age of 36, completely revolutionized the way we look at the reality.

And what impresses me most is the fact that he did it mostly by using his intuition, and by relying almost completely on mathematics.

Today I was reading about him and how he came up with the *general theory of relativity*. I stood open-mouthed for almost five minutes next to the metro platform. So beautiful. So mind-blowing.

It's very reassuring to know that there exist such a kind of human beings, able to perform such a grandiose mind feats. This gives me hope and makes me dreamy.

I wonder what the potential Einsteins of our days are working on... I can't wait to see what they will bring us.

My head is still spinning like the earth in the [space-time vortex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAPv5s92z0). Just WOW!
